/* 
No program exists for sorting words within a file. Write such a program.
Given any number of files on the command line, the program should extract all words 
(delimited by whitespace) from the file, and print them to stdout, sorted lexicographically, one word per line.
With no arguments, it should read from stdin. No other output during normal operation is permitted.
